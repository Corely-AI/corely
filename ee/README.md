# Corely Enterprise Packs (EE)

This folder is a placeholder for **commercial** Corely Enterprise Packs.

- EE code is **not** included in OSS builds by default.
- EE is distributed separately under a commercial license.
- OSS components must **not** import EE modules directly. Integration happens via ports/interfaces and runtime registration (plugin/registry).

See `ee/LICENSE-EE.md` for the commercial license placeholder and contact information.
