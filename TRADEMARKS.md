# Corely Trademark Policy

This policy covers use of the **Corely** name, logos, and brand assets. It is a practical summary, not legal advice.

## General rule

Forks and derivative projects must **not** use Corely branding in a way that implies affiliation, endorsement, or origin.

## You must do this if you fork

- Remove Corely name, logo, and visual identity from your fork.
- Choose a new project name and replace branding in UIs, documentation, and metadata.

## Allowed nominative use

You may use the Corely name in a truthful, non-confusing way to describe compatibility or origin, for example:

- “Fork of Corely”
- “Compatible with Corely”

These statements must not imply endorsement.

## Prohibited uses

- Using the Corely name or logo as the primary brand for your fork or service.
- Using confusingly similar names or logos that imply Corely affiliation.
- Registering domains or social handles that suggest official Corely ownership.

## Permission requests

If you want to use Corely trademarks beyond the allowed nominative uses, request permission at **<TRADEMARK_EMAIL>**.

## Brand assets

See `assets/README.md` for the separate terms governing logo and brand asset files.
